# Minim-Depth-of-Binary-Tree


This Python project provides a solution to compute the **minimum depth** of a binary tree using **recursive depth-first search (DFS)**.

A binary tree's minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the **nearest leaf node**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Uses recursion to handle all edge cases correctly
- Includes an example tree to test the function
- Clean, beginner-friendly Python code
- Modular structure for easy integration
